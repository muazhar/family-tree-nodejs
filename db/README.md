# Database Directory

This directory is where all databases get stored in a sub-directory of the name of the database.
For example if the database is called ``woodbridge`` then the database will get stored as
``db/woodbridge/woodbridge.db``. Also ``woodbridge.about`` and ``woodbridge.cfg`` based on the
``sample-db.about`` and sample-db.cfg`` should be saved into ``db/woodbridge/`` directory.
